# Reorder PDF Pages

A command-line tool to fix PDFs scanned one-sided at a time (e.g., all odd pages, then all even pages) so that they are reordered into proper sequential order.

This script is compatible with **macOS** and **Windows** and supports **drag-and-drop input** on both systems.

## âœ¨ Features

- Interleaves odd and even scanned pages into correct order
- Preserves original PDF folder location
- Supports drag-and-drop file paths
- Cross-platform: macOS â˜‘ Windows â˜‘
- Uses fast, isolated Python environments via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## ðŸš€ Installation

### 1. Install `pipx` (if not already installed)

**macOS (via Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

Windows (via Python):

python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

Restart your terminal afterward.

2. Install uv using pipx

pipx install uv

3. Set up the environment and install dependencies

uv venv
uv pip install PyPDF2

âš¡ Usage

Option A: Interactive Mode

uv venv run python reorder_pdf.py

You will be prompted:

Enter the full path of the scanned PDF file:

Drag the PDF into the terminal window (macOS or Windows), then press Enter.

Output:

A new file will be saved in the same folder with _reordered added to its name:

Original:  /Users/peter/Downloads/Report.pdf
Reordered: /Users/peter/Downloads/Report_reordered.pdf
```

ðŸ¤” How It Works

If a PDF is scanned odd-pages first (1, 3, 5â€¦) followed by even-pages (2, 4, 6â€¦), the pages appear out of order.

This script:
	1.	Splits the document into odd and even halves
	2.	Reverses the even half (if needed)
	3.	Interleaves odd and even pages: 1,2,3,4,5,6â€¦

It also handles files with an odd total number of pages.
